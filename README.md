# Env-sensor


Cost effective solution for Data Center or POP.

monitors temp and humidity using ADA-AM2302 and voltage diffrence using ADA-MCP3008.

send alerts using smtp and monitored data can be polled through snmp.

Data stored in database for treding purpose and future features.

Currently working
=================

Temperature sensor

Humidity sensor

External voltage drop and fluctuation

snmp data polling

Triggering & alerting with Email 

Showing current values on webpage on analogue gauge


future work
===========
console-server (done but not implemented)

smoke alarm

video surveillance

web-server for remote operation and data statistics (partially done)

door sensors

screen for live view on hardware
